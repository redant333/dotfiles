# Dot files

This is a repository that contains dot files and scripts that I use on Linux and Windows. Below is the summary of what each folder contains. Feel free to take a look around.

:open_file_folder: autohotkey

Two AutoHotkey scripts,
- `mode56.ahk` - introduces a new modifier key which enables Vim style hjkl navigation.
- `winLetterHotkeys.ahk` - inspired by 80/20 rule, binds activation of most commonly used windows to Win+Letter hotkeys which replaces Alt+Tabbing.

:open_file_folder: git

Simple `.gitconfig` with custom log format and some tig settings.

:open_file_folder: snippets_script

A dmenu based script for inserting long text snippets for situations when aliases and functions are not applicable. See [README.md](https://github.com/redant333/dotfiles/tree/master/snippets_script) for more info.

:open_file_folder: vim

`.vimrc` I'm experimenting with. Wouldn't trust it too much if I were you.

:open_file_folder: vimium

Settings for [Vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium) Chrome extension. Mostly here because of custom search engines.

:open_file_folder: vscode

VisualStudio Code settings and keybindings. Also contains a list of useful extensions.

:open_file_folder: zsh-oh-my-zsh

`.zshrc` for use with oh-my-zsh. Most notable features:
- Syntax highlighting for `less`
- Bunch of aliases
- Nice calculator function (execute with `c 1 + 3`)
- Custom theme (because oh-my-zsh does not have enough of them, it seems)
- Auto installation script (check [README.md](https://github.com/redant333/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh-oh-my-zsh))
