# Zsh + oh-my-zsh
This folder contains the following:
- `.zshrc` file with settings, aliases, functions, etc.
- `ghi.zsh-theme` that is used in .zshrc. The left prompt contains red á—ˆ, current folder and red colon. The right prompt contains current Git branch when in a repository.
- `install.sh` script that installs the package dependencies, downloads oh-my-zsh and the previous two files.
